    "text": "What is behavioral science\n\nBehavioral science is a transdisciplinary lens that seeks to explain and predict the environmental causes and psychological processes that underlie the decisions, emotions, and behaviors of individuals, groups, and organizations.\nI have long been a strong advocate of this approach, which brings together psychology and public policy, and was fortunate enough to become the behavioral science and insights expert for the French Public Employment Service (PES) while working on my doctoral dissertation.\n\n\n\nWhat I had the opportunity to do\n\nThere, I had the opportunity to work with some of the most competent and caring experts in the field, who have taught me a great deal. Overall, we have:\n\n\nTested several ways to apply behavioral science to a variety of contexts, including employment of people with disabilities, the online application form, hands-on work experience that allows an unemployed person to experience a work situation, or the relationship between a caseworker and a job seeker.\nIncorporated basic psychological concepts into the initial and ongoing vocational training of caseworkers, such as (job search) self-efficacy, the different forms of (re)work motivation, the importance of the social norm, etc., which then had a positive influence on the relationship between a caseworker and a client.\nDemonstrated the relevance of the behavioral science approach, which has become part of the global range of expertise used by PES to construct and develop public employment policies.\n\n\nI also had the opportunity to present our work to the Network of European Public Employment Services (the PES Network) and to help prepare a meeting of the G20 Behavioral Insights Knowledge Exchange Network for the French authorities.\n\n\n\nWhat I would like to keep doing\n\nAs of today, my overall goal is to further develop my skills and abilities in the application of psychology to both the construction and development of public policy.

We argue that unemployed people carry a stigma, defined as a mark that brings discredit and reduces a person to a despised characteristic. We use the Reinert unsupervised exploratory lexicometric method to analyze 12,996 articles published in the French written press from 2005 to 2021 to reveal the media images of the unemployed. First, the unemployed represent 0.027% of the articles published over the period studied, reflecting a very low visibility. Second, the main actor is largely absent from this media treatment, as the unemployed are mostly portrayed as a statistical and political issue rather than as people and experiences. Third, the unemployed present themselves as willing to work at almost any cost, but are sometimes portrayed as at least partly responsible for their situation. A better understanding of the image of the unemployed and its dissemination in the media allows for a better understanding of the stigma of unemployment.\n\n\n\n\nThe R script will be published soon.

We examine whether their expectation of being stigmatized, measured as stigma consciousness, predicts core psychological processes, objective job search behavior, and access to employment both after three months. First, we translated the Stigma Consciousness Questionnaire (Pinel, 1999) into French, and adapted it to a population of jobseekers. Then, we sent a survey to a large and representative sample of unemployed people in France. Finally, responses were linked to administrative databases of the Public Employment Service to assess objective job search behavior and access to employment (N = 30,000; n = 2,055). The scale showed good psychometric properties. Controlling for important confounders, stigma consciousness negatively predicted well-being, reported health, and life satisfaction, and positively predicted social and identified-regulated motivation to (re)work. Three months after responding to our survey, stigma consciousness predicted a more active job search among jobseekers who had been unemployed for at least one year. This did not lead to more reemployment, after three or five months. We provide evidence for a French version of the Stigma Consciousness Questionnaire and highlight its negative associations with core psychological processes among all unemployed people. Our results depict active long-term jobseekers trying to manage their stigma by pursuing an individual mobility strategy. This does not lead to regaining employment, which could make them more stigma conscious and subsequently worsen their well-being, health, and life satisfaction, in turn affecting their ability to work in a detrimental cycle.\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses and methods have been preregistered.

We survey a large and representative sample of unemployed people in France to investigate their experiences of stigma on a daily or acute basis; their anticipation of being the target of stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination; and their internalization of the stigma of unemployment. The responses, which are still being analyzed, mostly report high levels of acute and daily experiences of stigma; high levels of stigma consciousness and moderate levels of anticipation of stigmatization; and moderate to low levels of internalization of the stigma of unemployment.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a re analysis of data collected with Emma de Araujo for the work A focus on the interplay of socio-emotional skills, beliefs and stigma to predict job-search behaviors among the unemployed.

As such, they may form a welcome addition to the toolbox available to Public Employment Services to bridge labor supply and demand. However, there are certain challenges associated with their adoption. For instance, vulnerable populations may face difficulties in utilizing digital tools effectively. In this study, we evaluate the impact of a communication campaign by email designed to encourage the use of an online matching platform maintained by the French Public Employment Service, Pôle emploi. We designed several email templates that combined information, support, or motivational content to encourage jobseekers to engage with their profiles on the platform. In order to discover email effectiveness, we implement an adaptive experiment (contextual bandit) where the goal is to use past jobseekers’ take-up responses and characteristics to determine email allocation in the future, reducing gradually the allocation of less promising templates. Additionally, we built an optimal personalization allocation strategy based on collected data and test its effectiveness. Emails had a positive impact on the usage of the platform, as measured by a wide range of outcomes. However, attempts at learning a personalized emailing strategy did not manage to significantly improve on a random allocation of email templates.\n\n\n\n\nThe pre-registration can be found at the American Economic Association’s registry for randomized controlled trials.

As a result, it is unclear which psychological factors are relatively more influential in the job search process. We conceptualize job search as a goal-directed, self-regulatory process that involves core psychological processes to initiate and maintain job search behavior. We draw on cognitive and social-cognitive psychology to integrate three complementary levels of analysis related to self-regulatory mechanisms: the personal-cognitive level, with social-emotional and cognitive skills; the personal-self level, with beliefs about one’s own skills and abilities; the interpersonal and intergroup level, with stigmatization. The results will allow (1) to map the relative importance of key self-regulatory mechanisms at complementary levels of analysis; and (2) to test psychological notions that have never been evaluated and that may play a role in the job search process.\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses and methods have been preregistered.

En psychologie, la plupart des travaux ont expliqué ces effets au travers d’une perspective individuelle, laissant dans l’ombre la dimension intergroupe. Pourtant, de la situation de chômage émergent deux groupes, celui des travailleur⸱euses et celui des chômeur⸱euses. Alors que le premier est en adéquation avec une norme sociale valorisée « celle de travailler », le second, par déviance à cette norme, est la cible de préjugés véhiculés par la société. Confronté à la dévalorisation, le groupe des chômeurs et des chômeuses développe une identité sociale négative nuisant à la santé mentale et l’insertion sociale et professionnelle. Cette configuration est la voie principale conduisant au processus de stigmatisation. Quelles sont les stratégies de défense de soi que les chômeur·euses mettent en oeuvre pour le contrer ? Les travaux que nous avons réalisés montrent que, contrairement à de nombreux groupes qui parviennent à protéger leur santé mentale en s’identifiant davantage à leur groupe d’appartenance (par ex., les femmes), les personnes sans emploi ne bénéficient pas des effets positifs d’une telle stratégie, que du contraire. Toutefois, lorsque les chômeur⸱euses contestent le bien-fondé de la dévalorisation qui s’exerce à l’égard de leur groupe, leur identité acquiert une valeur protectrice. Nous développerons cette dimension dans le chapitre, qui se conclut par une réflexion sur les liens entre la stigmatisation, les stratégies de défense de soi et les questions d’intégration au sein du marché de l’emploi.\n\n\n\n\nKeywords: Chômage, Stigmatisation, Coping\n\nProprietary chapter, which cannot be shared."
