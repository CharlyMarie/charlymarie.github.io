    "text": "What is behavioural science\n\nBehavioural science is a transdisciplinary lens that seeks to explain and predict the environmental causes and psychological processes that underlie the decisions, emotions, and behaviours of individuals, groups, and organisations.\nI have long been a strong advocate of this approach, which brings together psychology and public policy, and was fortunate enough to become the behavioural science expert for the French Public Employment Service (PES) while working on my doctoral dissertation.\n\n\n\nWhat I had the opportunity to do\n\nThere, I had the opportunity to work with some of the most competent and caring experts in the field, who have taught me a great deal. Overall, we have:\n\n\nTested several ways to apply behavioural science to a variety of contexts, including employment of people with disabilities, the online application form, hands-on work experience that allows an unemployed person to experience a work situation, or the relationship between a caseworker and a job seeker.\nIncorporated basic psychological concepts into the initial and ongoing vocational training of caseworkers, such as (job search) self-efficacy, the different forms of (re)work motivation, the importance of the social norm, etc., which then had a positive influence on the relationship between a caseworker and a client.\nDemonstrated the relevance of the behavioural science approach, which has become part of the global range of expertise used by PES to construct and develop public employment policies.\n\n\nI also had the opportunity to present our work to the Network of European Public Employment Services (the PES Network) and to help prepare a meeting of the G20 Behavioural Insights Knowledge Exchange Network for the French authorities.\n\n\n\nWhat I would like to keep doing\n\nAs of today, my overall goal is to further develop my skills and abilities in the application of psychology to both the construction and development of public policy. See the Research page for some of the work we have done to this end."

    "text": "Hello,\nI am a Social Psychology PhD, currently undertaking a postdoctoral fellowship at LAPEA.\nWith a few wonderful co-authors, my work focuses on two main themes:\n\n\nThe social stigma of unemployment. Its forms and consequences for those who experience it and those who can implement it. Much of this work is available for download on the Research webpage.\nThe application of psychological theories, also known as behavioural science, to the creation, development, and evolution of public policies. This led me to work for the French public employment service, where I was a behavioural science expert. We conducted a few work on the topic, that can also be accessed from the Research page. I also pursue this line of research in my post-doc, that focuses on evaluating driver rehabilitation courses.\n\n\nIn addition to these research interests, I also aim to promote better research practices through teaching on topics such as:\n\n\nUsing R as an end-to-end data analysis tool. From importing and cleaning data to performing analyses and creating plots. Ideally, this would be done using Markdown. See, for instance, the file ‘Analyses principales - Matériel supplémentaire.html’ here or material shared on the Academic teching page.\nImproving students’ statistical literacy, by focusing on the (general-ised-) linear model and its many applications, as well as causal inference and its underlying assumptions.\n\n\nI do so by teaching at different universities, including Paris-Cité University, Sorbonne-Nouvelle University, Paris-Nanterre University, and the University of Lorraine."

To ensure a clear understanding and broaden the tool’s validity across diverse populations, it was tested among three groups: students, job seekers, and employees. Four samples participated in the survey: students (N = 221, N = 507), job seekers (N = 270), and employees (N = 328). Participants completed the adapted self-esteem contingency scale along with other selected scales to assess convergent and discriminant validity. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory analyses (CFA, ESEM, Bifactor-CFA, and Bifactor-ESEM) were conducted to explore the scale’s structure. The EFA revealed a two-dimensional structure, while the confirmatory analyses suggested a bifactorial model composed of one global factor and three specific factors: contingency regarding competence, self-criticism, and contingency regarding relationships. The bifactorial model demonstrated good internal consistency across all groups and satisfactory temporal stability. Correlation analyses with other constructs supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the scale. Overall, the shortened and adapted French version of the self-esteem contingency measure is a valid and reliable instrument. It assesses global self-esteem contingency while accounting for the specificities related to the needs for competence and affiliation. This dual focus enhances the scale’s applicability in both research and intervention contexts.\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nKeywords: self-esteem contingency; measurement; adaptation; validation; French\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\n\nCharly Marie, David Bourguignon\nEuropean Journal of Social Psychology, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Abstract and Keywords\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployed people face a stigmatizing representation leading to adverse outcomes. Its origin, content, evolution and transmission remain understudied. We use a lexicometric method to examine how ‘the unemployed’ are represented in 12,996 French press articles from 2005 to 2022. First, unemployed people represent 0.03% of all articles published during the study period. Second, we identify six mostly disembodied frames that reflect activation policies and almost exclusively individualize the cause of unemployment: unemployed people as statistics and economic data, political debates on unemployment, implementation of unemployment policies, local and organizational support, personal stories and realities of unemployment and collective actions. Only the frame of personal stories correlates with unemployment rate, suggesting increased humanization during economic crises. Third, when depicted, unemployed individuals are portrayed as persevering and willing poor men in need of guidance and support, who adhere to a strong social norm to work and take personal responsibility for their situation.\nThe research material is the property of Europresse and cannot be shared.

We show that unemployed people are also rated the lowest when compared to a high-high occupation (firefighters) and a low-low occupation (railroad workers). In Study 2, we replicate these findings with university students (n = 193) and show that unemployed people are also blatantly dehumanised when compared to the same targets. In Study 3, we show that vocational integration workers (n = 123) also rate unemployed people lower than employed people on both dimensions and facets, but not on morality. Overall, we conclude that unemployed people have a highly destructive stereotype that is lacking in every dimension and facet, and that they are overly despised.\nThe data is available on the Open Science Framework, along with the R code to replicate the analyses, tables and figures from the three studies: https://osf.io/8skqj/.\nKeywords: dehumanisation; stereotype content; stigma; unemployed; vocational integration workers\n\n\n\nDownload"
