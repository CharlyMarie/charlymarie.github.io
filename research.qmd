## Abstract
Having a job is a social norm in many countries, and violating this norm can be very badly perceived. We argue that unemployed people carry a stigma, defined as a mark that brings discredit and reduces a person to a despised characteristic. We use the Reinert unsupervised exploratory lexicometric method to analyze 12,996 articles published in the French written press from 2005 to 2021 to reveal the media images of the unemployed. First, the unemployed represent 0.027% of the articles published over the period studied, reflecting a very low visibility. Second, the main actor is largely absent from this media treatment, as the unemployed are mostly portrayed as a statistical and political issue rather than as people and experiences. Third, the unemployed present themselves as willing to work at almost any cost, but are sometimes portrayed as at least partly responsible for their situation. A better understanding of the image of the unemployed and its dissemination in the media allows for a better understanding of the stigma of unemployment.

## Abstract
Previous studies have shown that unemployed people are negatively stereotyped and stigmatized. We take their perspective to examine whether their expectation of being stigmatized (stigma consciousness) predicts their well-being, health, life satisfaction, motivation to (re) work, job search behavior and access to employment both after 3 months. First, we translate and validate the Stigma Consciousness Questionnaire (Pinel, 1999) into French, tailored for a population of job seekers. We then send a survey to a large and representative sample of the unemployed in France. Finally, we merge our survey responses with administrative databases provided by the French Public Employment Service (PES). Controlling for important third variables, we show that the more stigma-conscious unemployed people are, the lower their well-being, health, and life satisfaction. Stigma consciousness also predicts more social and more identified-integrated motivations to (re)work. Anticipated stigma predicts more job search behavior after 3 months, only among jobseekers who have been unemployed for at least 1 year. This more active job search does not translate into more employment after 3 or 5 months. Taken together, our results show that the expectation of being stigmatized is related to core psychological processes among all unemployed people. Moreover, the more stigma-conscious long-term jobseekers are, the more actively they try to manage their stigma and cope with their situation by pursuing an individual mobility strategy to escape unemployment and its associated stigma.

## Abstract
Previous studies have shown that unemployed people are negatively stereotyped and stigmatized, but few have taken their perspective, and no victimization survey has ever been conducted. We survey a large and representative sample of unemployed people in France to investigate their experiences of stigma on a daily or acute basis; their anticipation of being the target of stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination; and their internalization of the stigma of unemployment. The responses, which are still being analyzed, mostly report high levels of acute and daily experiences of stigma; high levels of stigma consciousness and moderate levels of anticipation of stigmatization; and moderate to low levels of internalization of the stigma of unemployment.

## Abstract
Digital matching platforms promise to reduce frictions on the labor market by providing low-cost information on available positions and candidates. As such, they may form a welcome addition to the toolbox available to Public Employment Services to bridge labor supply and demand. However, there are certain challenges associated with their adoption. For instance, vulnerable populations may face difficulties in utilizing digital tools effectively. In this study, we evaluate the impact of a communication campaign by email designed to encourage the use of an online matching platform maintained by the French Public Employment Service, Pôle emploi. We designed several email templates that combined information, support, or motivational content to encourage jobseekers to engage with their profiles on the platform. In order to discover email effectiveness, we implement an adaptive experiment (contextual bandit) where the goal is to use past jobseekers' take-up responses and characteristics to determine email allocation in the future, reducing gradually the allocation of less promising templates. Additionally, we built an optimal personalization allocation strategy based on collected data and test its effectiveness. Emails had a positive impact on the usage of the platform, as measured by a wide range of outcomes. However, attempts at learning a personalized emailing strategy did not manage to significantly improve on a random allocation of email templates.

## Abstract
Temporary abstract: In this paper, we propose to investigate the benefits of the use of digital matching platform. In partnership with the French Public Employment Service, France travail, we encourage randomly selected registered jobseekers to fill-in and publish their profile on the PES platform to make them more visible to recruiters. We then track the effects of the intervention on a large variety of outcomes, including employment, using rich administrative data and web logs provided by the French Employment Service.

## Abstract
Temporary abstract: Research has identified psychological predictors of job search behavior, but much of it has been conducted in separate streams of research and often studied in isolation from one another. As a result, it is unclear which psychological factors are relatively more influential in the job search process. We conceptualize job search as a goal-directed, self-regulatory process that involves core psychological processes to initiate and maintain job search behavior. We draw on cognitive and social-cognitive psychology to integrate three complementary levels of analysis related to self-regulatory mechanisms: the personal-cognitive level, with social-emotional and cognitive skills; the personal-self level, with beliefs about one's own skills and abilities; the interpersonal and intergroup level, with stigmatization. The results will allow (1) to map the relative importance of key self-regulatory mechanisms at complementary levels of analysis; and (2) to test psychological notions that have never been evaluated and that may play a role in the job search process.

## Abstract
Les effets délétères de la privation d'emploi sur la santé mentale sont largement étayés dans la littérature scientifique. En psychologie, la plupart des travaux ont expliqué ces effets au travers d'une perspective individuelle, laissant dans l'ombre la dimension intergroupe. Pourtant, de la situation de chômage émergent deux groupes, celui des travailleur⸱euses et celui des chômeur⸱euses. Alors que le premier est en adéquation avec une norme sociale valorisée « celle de travailler », le second, par déviance à cette norme, est la cible de préjugés véhiculés par la société. Confronté à la dévalorisation, le groupe des chômeurs et des chômeuses développe une identité sociale négative nuisant à la santé mentale et l'insertion sociale et professionnelle. Cette configuration est la voie principale conduisant au processus de stigmatisation. Quelles sont les stratégies de défense de soi que les chômeur·euses mettent en oeuvre pour le contrer ? Les travaux que nous avons réalisés montrent que, contrairement à de nombreux groupes qui parviennent à protéger leur santé mentale en s'identifiant davantage à leur groupe d'appartenance (par ex., les femmes), les personnes sans emploi ne bénéficient pas des effets positifs d'une telle stratégie, que du contraire. Toutefois, lorsque les chômeur⸱euses contestent le bien-fondé de la dévalorisation qui s'exerce à l'égard de leur groupe, leur identité acquiert une valeur protectrice. Nous développerons cette dimension dans le chapitre, qui se conclut par une réflexion sur les liens entre la stigmatisation, les stratégies de défense de soi et les questions d'intégration au sein du marché de l'emploi.
