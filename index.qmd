Hello,

I am a Ph.D. candidate in social-cognitive psychology under the supervision of Prof. [David Bourguignon](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dYsZHoQAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=sra){target="_blank"}. I am also a *behavioral science expert* for the French public employment service.

With a few wonderful co-authors, my work focuses on two main themes: 

::: {} 
1. The social assignment of the unemployed, its forms and consequences for those who experience it and those who can implement it. 
2. The use of psychological theories and methods, also known as *behavioral science*, applied to the construction and development of public policies. 
:::

I also teach at the Sorbonne-Nouvelle University in Paris, France.
